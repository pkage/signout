>> As fellow students at Choate Rosemary Hall, it is our duty to think about how we can benefit this community. I think we should put our talents to work.
>> I came up with an idea, its actually an old idea that I didn’t have the time to see it through.
>>
>> So y’all know how the sign-out process is a pain in the rear end right? (Patrick will get this, Alex you get the general gist)
>> You start off by signing out at the dean’s office. You grab the slip, then you go back and get permission at your house advisor. THEN you come back and put your slip back in the Dean’s office. It’s redundant, it’s a pain, people hate it.
>>
>> We can create a web app that can do this entire process, from beginning to end.
>> Here is the general idea:
>>         1. Logins: There are three categories of accounts - students, deans/assistants, house advisors. Uses Choate ID to log in, and you set up which one you are, etc.
>>         2. Initial sign out process: You start by registering your sign out. You submit a form with your initial info - where you going, when and how, invitations etc.
>>         3. This form is then locked and only accessible by the dean/assistant. He/she then will confirm it’s info and push it to get permission from the Dean.
>>         4. Dean confirms, send it back to you.
>>         5. You push the semi-complete form to your house advisors. They sign it, and it’s complete.
>>         6. Send it back to Sanctum.
>>
>> All of this could be done on the web, accessible through iPhone/andriod as well. The general benefit of this is that everyone could do it from the comfort of their homes, all without walking in the terrible weather outside, or entirely forgetting it.
>>
>> P.S. If we collab on this and make parts of the school adapt it, we could massively inspire interests for CPU.
>> Tell me what you think.
